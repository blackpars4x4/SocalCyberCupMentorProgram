# Socal Cyber Cup Mentor Program

www.socalcybercup.org

The SoCal Cyber Cup Mentorship program is a website dedicated to providing mentorship opportunities for individuals who would like to participate in the SoCal Cyber Cup. The SoCal Cyber Cup Mentorship website is the capstone project for four National University Cyber Security Graduate students. The overall goal of the project is to build a website as a repository of information and guidelines for future SoCal Cyber Cup mentors and participants.

I am very happy that our website and research will be used and becomes part of an actual competition program.
